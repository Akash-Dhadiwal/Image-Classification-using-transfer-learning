In this file, I have included the model training script. Additionally, I have added the Flask application code in the app1.py file. Ensure that the CSS and JavaScript files are placed in the static folder, with separate subfolders for css and js. The HTML files should be located in the templates folder. To run the application, navigate to the directory in your terminal and execute the .py file.
